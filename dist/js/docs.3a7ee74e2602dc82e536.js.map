文档编写\\n\\n当你完成一个组件后，首先到`src/index.js`中确保组件已注册。然后`examples/views`下创建一个组件目录，添加一个`index.vue`文件用于输出该组件对应的路由页面，添加一个与目录名一致的`.md`文件用于书写文档。\\n\\n**示例：**\\n\\n```bash\\n🗁 examples\\n|--🗁 views\\n    `--🗁 testComponent\\n    |  |--🗎 index.vue\\n    |  `--🗎 testComponent.md\\n```\\n\\n编辑刚才添加的`index.vue`文件，添加以下内容：\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page></docs-page>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n`docs-page`组件是预定义好文档格式的容器组件，组件的内容由`.md`文件渲染后填充。提供唯一的插槽用于书写组件示例。\\n\\n现在打开`md`文件编写组件文档，格式如下：\\n\\n```md\\n# 组件名\\n\\n组件描述。。。\\n\\n## 代码用例\\n\\n<!--code -->\\n\\n## API\\n\\n……\\n```\\n\\n`<!--code -->`是个占位符，因为`markdown`中不能很好的解析出代码示例，所以在`docs-page`组件读取到`markdown`后这个占位符对应到组件的插槽。也就是说代码示例需要手动引入。\\n\\n> `<!--code -->` 中间的空格不需要，这里是避免被误解析。\\n\\n提供了`code-block`组件用于展示代码示例。\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page>\\n        <code-block title=\\\"简单使用\\\"\\n                    :code=\\\"simpleCode\\\">\\n

labelCode\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n`code-block`只有3个接口，分别是`props:title`、`props:code`、`slots:default`。把每个示例编写为独立的组件引入，组件代码使用`raw-loader`以文本形式引入。\\n\\n看不明白的话可以结合具体的文件查看。\\n\"\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/

组件目录\\n|--🗁 styles\\n`--🗎 index.js\\n```\\n\\n## 文档编写\\n\\n当你完成一个组件后，首先到`src/index.js`中确保组件已注册。然后`examples/views`下创建一个组件目录，添加一个`index.vue`文件用于输出该组件对应的路由页面，添加一个与目录名一致的`.md`文件用于书写文档。\\n\\n**示例：**\\n\\n```bash\\n🗁 examples\\n|--🗁 views\\n    `--🗁 testComponent\\n    |  |--🗎 index.vue\\n    |  `--🗎 testComponent.md\\n```\\n\\n编辑刚才添加的`index.vue`文件，添加以下内容：\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page></docs-page>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n`docs-page`组件是预定义好文档格式的容器组件，组件的内容由`.md`文件渲染后填充。提供唯一的插槽用于书写组件示例。\\n\\n现在打开`md`文件编写组件文档，格式如下：\\n\\n```md\\n# 组件名\\n\\n组件描述。。。\\n\\n## 代码用例\\n\\n<!--code -->\\n\\n## API\\n\\n……\\n```\\n\\n`<!--code -->`是个占位符，因为`markdown`中不能很好的解析出代码示例，所以在`docs-page`组件读取到`markdown`后这个占位符对应到组件的插槽。也就是说代码示例需要手动引入。\\n\\n> `<!--code -->` 中间的空格不需要，这里是避免被误解析。\\n\\n提供了`code-block`组件用于展示代码示例。\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page>\\n        <code-block title=\\\"简单使用\\\"\\n                    :code=\\\"simpleCode\\\">\\n

labelCode\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n`code-block`只有3个接口，分别是`props:title`、`props:code`、`slots:default`。把每个示例编写为独立的组件引入，组件代码使用`raw-loader`以文本形式引入。\\n\\n看不明白的话可以结合具体的文件查看。\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n//
