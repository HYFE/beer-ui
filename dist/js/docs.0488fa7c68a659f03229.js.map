文档编写\\n\\n当你完成一个组件后，首先到`src/index.js`中确保组件已注册。然后`examples/views`下创建一个组件目录，添加一个`index.vue`文件用于输出该组件对应的路由页面，添加一个与目录名一致的`.md`文件用于书写文档。\\n\\n**示例：**\\n\\n```bash\\n🗁 examples\\n|--🗁 views\\n    `--🗁 testComponent\\n    |  |--🗎 index.vue\\n    |  `--🗎 testComponent.md\\n```\\n\\n编辑刚才添加的`index.vue`文件，添加以下内容：\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page></docs-page>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n`docs-page`组件是预定义好文档格式的容器组件，组件的内容由`.md`文件渲染后填充。提供唯一的插槽用于书写组件示例。\\n\\n现在打开`md`文件编写组件文档，格式如下：\\n\\n```md\\n# 组件名\\n\\n组件描述。。。\\n\\n## 代码用例\\n\\n<!--code -->\\n\\n## API\\n\\n……\\n```\\n\\n`<!--code -->`是个占位符，因为`markdown`中不能很好的解析出代码示例，所以在`docs-page`组件读取到`markdown`后这个占位符对应到组件的插槽。也就是说代码示例需要手动引入。\\n\\n> `<!--code -->` 中间的空格不需要，这里是避免被误解析。\\n\\n提供了`code-block`组件用于展示代码示例。\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page>\\n        <code-block title=\\\"简单使用\\\"\\n                    :code=\\\"simpleCode\\\">\\n

Events\\r\\n\\r\\n事件|描述|参数\\r\\n---|---|---\\r\\nchange|显示状态变化时触发|`visible`：是否可见\\r\\nshow|弹窗显示时触发|-\\r\\nhide|弹窗关闭时触发|-\\r\\ncreatePopover|弹窗创建时触发|`dataObject` [参考](https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html#dataObject)\\r\\nupdatePopover|弹窗更新时触发|`dataObject`\\r\\n\\r\\n### v-popover\\r\\n\\r\\n参数|描述|示例\\r\\n---|---|---\\r\\narg|指令参数与要关联的`popover`组件的`name`属性值一致。|`v-popover:hello`\\r\\nmodifiers.[trigger]|表示触发的事件，支持：`click`、`hover`、`focus`。省略该项时为`click`。|`v-popover:hello.hover`\\r\\nmodifiers.name|动态`name`，比如在一个循环中，你无法拼接一个指令`arg`值，你可以使用这种方式。|`v-popover.name=\\\"popName\\\"`\\r\\nmodifiers.only|定义单例的弹窗|`v-popover.only=\\\"settings\\\"`\\r\\nvalue|单例弹窗时传入单例弹窗及弹窗内显示内容组件的参数和事件等；或者动态`name`传入一个字符串|-\\r\\n\\r\\n## 单例弹窗\\r\\n\\r\\n### 全局配置\\r\\n\\r\\n仅用一个唯一的`props`用于公共的`popover`设置，可设置项对应`popover:props`。\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<ui-popover-holder :settings=\\\"yourSettings\\\"></ui-popover-holder>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### 指令值数据结构参考\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n{\\r\\n    component, // 弹窗里的内容组件\\r\\n\\r\\n    // 内容组件的 props 参数\\r\\n    /* 略... */\\r\\n\\r\\n    events: {}, // 内容组件的事件监听\\r\\n\\r\\n    popover: { // popover 参数传递，优先级高于全局配置\\r\\n\\r\\n        // popover: props\\r\\n        /* 略... */\\r\\n\\r\\n        events: {} // popover: events\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### 内部关闭弹窗\\r\\n\\r\\n单例弹窗内部实现了一个关闭弹窗的事件监听，内容组件需要关闭弹窗时，派发一个关闭事件即可。\\r\\n\\r\\n如下，也可参考 **单例** 中的`Click3`相关代码：\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nexport default {\\r\\n    methods: {\\r\\n        onHide() {\\r\\n            this.$emit('close:popover')\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### 也可以更Open\\r\\n\\r\\n可以在组件内使用`this`调用单例弹窗实例，去完成一些不可思议的操作。\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nexport default {\\r\\n    watch: {\\r\\n        $route() {\\r\\n            // 路由改变时关闭弹窗\\r\\n            this.$popover.visible = false\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n更多示例需要你去阅读源码发现。\\r\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./examples/views/popover/popover.md\n// module

examples\\n|--🗁 views\\n    `--🗁 testComponent\\n    |  |--🗎 index.vue\\n    |  `--🗎 testComponent.md\\n```\\n\\n编辑刚才添加的`index.vue`文件，添加以下内容：\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page></docs-page>\\n</template>\\n```\\n\\n`docs-page`组件是预定义好文档格式的容器组件，组件的内容由`.md`文件渲染后填充。提供唯一的插槽用于书写组件示例。\\n\\n现在打开`md`文件编写组件文档，格式如下：\\n\\n```md\\n# 组件名\\n\\n组件描述。。。\\n\\n## 代码用例\\n\\n<!--code -->\\n\\n## API\\n\\n……\\n```\\n\\n`<!--code -->`是个占位符，因为`markdown`中不能很好的解析出代码示例，所以在`docs-page`组件读取到`markdown`后这个占位符对应到组件的插槽。也就是说代码示例需要手动引入。\\n\\n> `<!--code -->` 中间的空格不需要，这里是避免被误解析。\\n\\n提供了`code-block`组件用于展示代码示例。\\n\\n```html\\n<template>\\n    <docs-page>\\n        <code-block title=\\\"简单使用\\\"\\n                    :code=\\\"simpleCode\\\">\\n
